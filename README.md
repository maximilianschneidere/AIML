      - [Coursera: Andrew Ng's ML Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

4. **Master Data Visualization and Exploration**
   - Essential tools for analyzing and understanding datasets:
      - Libraries: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
   - Learn how to:
      - Clean messy datasets
      - Identify trends and anomalies
   - Resources:
      - [Data Analysis with Python - freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uOLxNrNk8)

5. **Experiment with AI Projects**
   - Apply theory by building real-world projects:
      - Examples:
         - House Price Prediction (using `scikit-learn`)
         - Object Detection (using `tensorflow`)
         - Sentiment Analysis (e.g., Twitter data)
   - Datasets:
      - [Kaggle Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
